;;;;;Go Baby Go Initiative;;;;;&emsp;Over the course of summer, the Stealth Tigers undertook a major outreach project titled “Go Baby Go.” This is a national initiative that seeks to partner with hospitals to assist young children and toddlers who have developed some sort of physical ailment that limits mobility. The goal of the project is to take electric toy cars and modify them to be more accessible for these children. By completing these modifications, “Go Baby Go” combines physical therapy with fun, interactive entertainment. This summer, the Stealth Tigers partnered with the initiative and the local St. Joseph’s Hospital to become the team responsible for actually creating the necessary modifications for the cars.<br>&emsp;The Stealth Tigers were given the task of modifying two cars: a black Mercedes and a pink Mini Cooper. Since the two were different models, the team had to develop two different plans that were specific to their individual car. The Mercedes had a few requirements: a soft backboard to keep the driver upright, an adjustable steering wheel, and a button on the steering wheel to replace the standard pedal control. The backboard was created using the body of a boogie board, pool noodles, and PVC pipe. The result was a soft yet sturdy board that was angled just slightly for the children to be both comfortable and safe. The Stealth Tigers also had to redo some of the electrical wiring of the car to switch the control from the stock gas pedal to the new button they would be placing on the steering wheel. Along with that, the steering wheel was made to be adjustable so that any patient could be as comfortable as necessary. The Mercedes ultimately was a successful modification.<br>&emsp;The Mini Cooper provided a bit of a challenge for the Stealth Tigers: not only did it require the previous modifications, but it also needed to be slowed down since its top speed was determined to be too fast for what the children would need. This problem was solved by using a motor controller with an attached potentiometer to cap out the vehicle’s speed. Foam was chosen as the base of the backboard rather than the body of a boogie board. As the Mini Cooper model had some railing, it was necessary to pad that up as well. Another oddity of this car, unlike the Mercedes, was a Bluetooth controller that could drive the car remotely. Although they didn’t need to adjust the controller directly, it was important that they kept it intact. Despite these new challenges, the Stealth Tigers overcame them and provided the most optimal modifications possible for the children.<br>&emsp;With these two cars and the “Go Baby Go” project completed for the summer, the team is looking forward to hopefully not only reach out to assist with the initiative again but also to reach out to more of the community in an effort to give back to those who need it most. The team would like to extend a personal thanks to Lauren Rosen, the representative from St. Joseph’s who helped worked with us on the project. Thanks Lauren!;;;;;news/entry1.jpg;;;;;
