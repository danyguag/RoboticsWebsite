;;;;;2018 FRC Season;;;;;&emsp;Our season started off like any other FRC season: we watched the new game video and panicked. After our short panic attack, we started planning and designing our new robot. We started our design process by talking about the general type of robot we wanted, thinking about what wheels to use, what kind of intake system we wanted, and whether or not to go for the switch or scale. After discussing our general design and using several umbrella terms, we decided to come up with the specifics.<br>&emsp;We started with designing our intake and developed several prototype designs. Our initial plans included a pinching arm that would enable us to pick up and drop off the Power Cubes, but we eventually decided on a roller intake mechanism for the sake of efficiency and speed. This design has four wheels lining the inside of a bosche claw to assist in propelling the Power Cubes toward our robot and launching them away into the switches. With this intake system, our robot excelled in capturing the opposing switch and holding our own, making us a serious competitor in competitions.<br>&emsp;After creating our intake design and prototyping it, we discussed our climbing mechanism. Originally, the plan was to climb aided by a winch, which would help our robot pull itself up the climbing bar seven feet in the air. Restricted by time constraints and limited space on our chassis, we decided upon a linear slide powered by a double motor. We use a chain with a 14:1 gear ratio. Attached to the chain is our intake system, which we use to score in the switch. We also have two hooks carved by our own members screwed to the top of our linear slide, enabling us to climb. This linear slide allows us to climb in under 2 seconds, making us one of the fastest climbers at our competitions.<br>&emsp;Our intake and linear slide is situated on a chassis that has a motor for each wheel. We used mecanum wheels for our drivetrain, which allow us to strafe sideways and move faster than our opponents. Our speed and mobility helped our robot traverse the game field and cover multiple areas quickly without forfeiting our previous position. This maneuverability, combined with our incredibly efficient switch strategy, improved our reputation amongst other teams and made us a coveted teammate for alliances.<br>&emsp;After extensive design and build processes, we managed to make our world qualifying robot, Winchless. We spent six weeks creating this robot, pouring our heart and soul into the design, and it brought us to to the World Championship Competition in Houston, Texas.;;;;;projects/entry1.jpg;;;;;
